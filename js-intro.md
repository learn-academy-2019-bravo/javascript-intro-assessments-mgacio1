# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
a function is a set of instructions (code) that you want to perform.  The goal is automate a process as much as possible.
#### 2. What is a method?
methods are a variety of actions that can be applied to modify objects, strings, arrays, etc.  

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
.length() = provides the length of a string (starting at 1)
.concat() = joins two strings together
.charAt() = returns the character at the specified index
.split() = converts a string into an array

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Accessors and Mutator methods correspond to arrays.  Accessors (aka Getters) can modify an array without changing the original array:
.concat() = joins two arrays together
.join() = joins the values in an array and converts to a strings
.indexof() = finds the index of a specified value in an array

Mutuator (aka Setters) can modify an original array.
.push() = adds a value to the end of an array
.pop() = removes a value from the end of an array
.shift() = removes a value from the beginning of an array

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log() logs(prints) the information to the terminal(console). Typically used to ensure code is working (debug). It does not have any other program function.
return on the other hand, is normally used within a function.  It's used to pass a value from one scope to another.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
Adding your lecture notes to Slack and lecture video to YouTube are good points of reference.  Also, it helps when the instructors walk around during "Challenges" and provide feedback/comment.
